## About

[PEAK Modding](https://github.com/PEAKModding) is the GitHub organization of the modding community on [Thunderstore](https://thunderstore.io/c/peak/) for the game [PEAK](https://store.steampowered.com/app/3527290/PEAK/) by Aggro Crab and Landfall.

As an experienced modder I decided to help set up this GitHub organization for the modding community as this wasn't done yet.

### Modding Wiki

The first thing I did was set up the [modding wiki](https://peakmodding.github.io/) for the game. I used [Astro Starlight](https://starlight.astro.build/) for the docs site since it's just really awesome and I have the most experience with it.

### C# Project Template

I also created a C# template preconfigured for the game, which [can be found here](https://github.com/PEAKModding/BepInExTemplate). I didn't really have previous C# template creation experience, but forking off of an exiting template helped, though I modified it *a lot.*

### Community Modding API

The community wanted this to exist so I set it up, and [it can be found here](https://github.com/PEAKModding/PEAKLib).

The first thing added to it was the PEAKLib.Items API for adding items to the game, which was created based on already existing work, but turned into a general use API by me. This API is based on the [LC-ContentLib project](/projects/contentlib). And this is one of the first projects to use my [MonoDetour](/projects/monodetour) detouring library!

I've managed the project for now, reviewing and merging other people's pull requests. But a few other people could also do this since I'm not the only one who has permissions to do so.
