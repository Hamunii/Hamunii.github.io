## About

ContentLib is a modular API project for Lethal Company, with a focus on doing things right and providing
extensive documentation unlike the majority of popular modding APIs for the game. 

ContentLib is a rather ambitious project, although it started off with a smaller scope, with just me and another developer.
The scope grew with more contributors bringing more things they wanted to work on.

## Experience

I've gained a lot of experience from this project and learned to look up and follow standards for things,
like C# projects.

From figuring out how to make a nice website for documentation, I've learned to use more tools, but most
importantly I've learned to learn to use new tools.

## Current Status

As of writing, the API project is kind of on-hold as I and other contributors are busy at least temporarily,
and I'm looking forward to coming back to it and being able to use it for myself in my mods.
