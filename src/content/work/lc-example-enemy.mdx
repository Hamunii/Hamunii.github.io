  When I started modding the game 'Lethal Company', there weren't any resources on making custom enemies. So I made the resources.

## What is It?

[LC-ExampleEnemy](https://github.com/Hamunii/LC-ExampleEnemy) is an example project that implements a custom enemy in Lethal Company.
It comes with documentation which is linked on the github page. I wrote most of its documentation, although I'm not the only contributor to it.

Since the creation of LC-ExampleEnemy, modded enemies have been much more frequent as the process became much more accessible.

## How It Came to Be

When Lethal Company modding was new, there weren't many resources on content creation.
So I learned how to make custom enemies, and documented the process alongside with making the example project for others to use.

## Current Status

I'm working on the project less now as another person has taken up the burden of maintaining the project, as I'm focusing on other projects.
