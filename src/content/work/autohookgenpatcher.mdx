## What is It?

[AutoHookGenPatcher](https://github.com/Hamunii/BepInEx.MonoMod.AutoHookGenPatcher) is a tool that automatically generates helper hook
assemblies using [MonoMod](https://github.com/MonoMod/MonoMod).RuntimeDetour.HookGen to make hooking methods in C# convenient.

It's a fork of [HookGenPatcher](https://github.com/harbingerofme/Bepinex.Monomod.HookGenPatcher), with the biggest difference being this:

“*Instead of only having a fixed list of files to generate MMHOOK files for, AutoHookGenPatcher will get the MMHOOK file references from installed plugins, and generates those MMHOOK files if possible.*”

It also has caching optimizations to prevent this from feature causing performance issues, which is arguably the most complicated part of the software. 

## Usage in Modding

The [Content Warning modding community](https://thunderstore.io/c/content-warning/) is fairly new and so it only uses this tool for generating hook helper files.
As of writing this post, the tool has just over **600K** downloads.
