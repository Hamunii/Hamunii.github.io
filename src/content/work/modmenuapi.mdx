## What is It?

A simple and minimal API for adding buttons to menus that are overlaid on the screen, intended for debugging purposes.

I've made developer tools for Lethal Company, and wanted an easy API for me and potentially others to use to make developing
developer tools easier for Unity games in general.

Due to its simlicity and design, the project is also easy to port for games made in other engines, which I will do if I start
modding a non-unity game.

## As a Public API

I've made sure that it's usable by other people by focusing on a helpful readme with clear instructions and examples and uploading it to
NuGet, though I've not had time to finish all the functionality of the API as I've had some side projects that are taking priority.
